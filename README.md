# 250 Days of Code

Welcome to my coding journey! I'm embarking on a 250-day challenge (starting April 25, 2025) to grow from beginner-level projects to more advanced full stack development. There are exactly 250 days left in the year, and I'm using this time to push my limits, learn new techniques, and build a solid portfolio.

## What This Is About

- **Learning by Doing:** I’m not just reading tutorials—I’m coding every day. My projects will evolve from simple starters to challenging, advanced applications.
- **Real-World Application:** This repo documents projects that go beyond basic examples. I dive into practical problems with the wealth of resources available online.
- **Inspiration for Others:** If you ever felt stuck or overwhelmed by where to begin, this journey is here to show step-by-step progress on tackling projects head-on.

## Why Document the Journey?

- **Self-Reflection:** Tracking progress day by day helps me identify improvements and reflect on my mistakes.
- **Community Guidance:** I hope to serve as a guide for anyone struggling with where to start or how to maintain momentum in their learning process.
- **Keep the Flow:** By documenting challenges and solutions, I'll provide insights into a continuous learning flow that isn't always covered in basic tutorials available on Google.

## What to Expect

- **Daily Updates:** Regular commits highlighting my daily progress, challenges, and breakthroughs.
- **Project Walkthroughs:** Detailed explanations, code snippets, and tips for every project.
- **Lessons Learned and Resources:** Real-world advice to help you overcome obstacles in your own coding journey.

Let's code, learn, and grow together. Happy coding!
