<h2>Books and Teaching</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Since Spring 2021, <a href="https://infosci.cornell.edu/people/karen-levy">Karen Levy</a> and I have been teaching a course entitled
        <a href="https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP21/class/INFO/1260">Choices and Consequences in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340)</a>.
        The course is designed at an introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and covers a range of ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and information.

        <ul>
            <li><em>This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach entitled <strong>Networks</strong>.
                The book, like the course, is designed at the introductory undergraduate level with no formal prerequisites.
                To support deeper explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented with optional advanced sections.</em></li>
            <li><em>There is an on-line <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/networks-crowds-and-markets">edX course</a> based on the book: <strong>Networks, Crowds, and Markets</strong>,
                taught jointly with David Easley and Eva Tardos.</em></li>
